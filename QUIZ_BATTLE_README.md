## API Documentation

### Socket.IO Events

#### Client to Server
```javascript
// Join battle room
socket.emit('joinBattleRoom', {
  roomId: string,
  userId: string,
  username: string
});

// Start battle
socket.emit('startBattle', {
  roomId: string,
  questions: Array
});

// Submit answer
socket.emit('answerQuestion', {
  roomId: string,
  userId: string,
  questionIndex: number,
  answer: number,
  isCorrect: boolean,
  timeSpent: number
});
```

#### Server to Client
```javascript
// Room joined
socket.on('roomJoined', (data) => {
  // Room state and user list
});

// Battle started
socket.on('battleStarted', (data) => {
  // Questions and start time
});

// Progress update
socket.on('updateProgress', (data) => {
  // Player progress and scores
});
```

### REST API Endpoints

```javascript
// Get all battle rooms
GET /api/battle-rooms

// Get specific room status
GET /api/battle-rooms/:roomId
```

## Scoring System

### Points Calculation
- **Base Score**: 100 points for correct answers
- **Speed Bonus**: Up to 50 points based on response time
- **Formula**: `baseScore + Math.max(0, 50 - Math.floor(timeSpent / 1000))`

### Example
- Correct answer in 2 seconds: 100 + 48 = 148 points
- Correct answer in 10 seconds: 100 + 40 = 140 points
- Wrong answer: 0 points

## Room Management

### Room States
- `waiting`: Players joining and getting ready
- `active`: Battle in progress
- `finished`: Battle completed

### Room Limits
- **Maximum Players**: 6 per room
- **Minimum Players**: 2 to start
- **Auto-cleanup**: Inactive rooms removed after 1 hour

### User Management
- Automatic removal of disconnected users
- Room deletion when empty
- Real-time user status updates

## Styling and Animations

### Design System
- **Color Scheme**: Purple/blue gradient theme
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts
- **Icons**: React Icons for consistent iconography
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions

### Key Animations
- Player movement on progress track
- Question transitions
- Notification popups
- Button hover effects
- Loading states

## Error Handling

### Common Scenarios
- **Room Full**: Maximum 6 players reached
- **Battle In Progress**: Cannot join active battles
- **Connection Lost**: Automatic reconnection handling
- **Invalid Room**: Room not found or expired

### User Feedback
- Real-time error notifications
- Clear error messages
- Graceful fallbacks
- Loading states

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization
- Efficient Socket.IO event handling
- Minimal re-renders with React optimization
- Debounced progress updates
- Memory cleanup for disconnected users

### Scalability
- Room-based isolation
- Stateless battle service
- Efficient data structures
- Connection pooling

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Create multiple browser tabs/windows
2. Join the same battle room
3. Test all game scenarios
4. Verify real-time updates

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Test Socket.IO connection
node test-socket.js

# Run frontend tests
npm test
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Custom Question Sets**: User-created quiz content
- **Tournament Mode**: Multi-round competitions
- **Spectator Mode**: Watch battles without participating
